Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

def solve(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    p,c,n = head,head.next,head.next.next
    while n:
        c.next = p
        p = c
        c = n
        n = n.next
    head.next = None
    c.next = p
    return c
