//For sure, the love mobiles will roll again on this summerâ€™s street parade. Each year, the organisers decide on a fixed order for the decorated trucks.
Experience taught them to keep free a side street to be able to bring the trucks into order.
You are given the array order in which the love mobiles arrive. Return 1 if love mobiles can be re-arranged to sorted order, else return 0.
